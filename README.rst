PyGitUp |Build Status|
======================

``PyGitUp`` is a Python implementation of the great
`aanand/git-up/ <https://github.com/aanand/git-up/>`__. It not only
fully covers the abilities of git-up and should be a drop-in replacement,
but also extends it slightly.

Why use ``git up``?
-------------------

    git pull has two problems:

    * It merges upstream changes by default, when it's really more polite to `rebase
      over them <http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/11/pull-with-rebase.html>`__,
      unless your collaborators enjoy a commit graph that looks like bedhead.

    * It only updates the branch you're currently on, which means git push will
      shout at you for being behind on branches you don't particularly care about
      right now.

Why use the Python port?
------------------------

I wasn't able to use the original ``git-up``, because I didn't want to install
a whole Ruby suite just for `git-up` and even with Ruby installed, there were
some problems running on my Windows machine. So, my reasons for writing
and using this port are:

1. Windows support.
2. Written in Python ;)

How do I install it?
--------------------

1. Run ``$ pip install git-up``
2. ``cd`` to your project's directory.
3. Run ``git up`` and enjoy!

Note for Windows users:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You need ``pip`` installed and working. Check out
`SO#4750806 <http://stackoverflow.com/q/4750806/997063>`__ for more
information. And don't forget to either:

- make your ``Python/Scripts`` and ``Python/Lib/site-packages`` writable for
  you,
- run ``pip`` with admin privileges
- or use ``pip install --user git-up`` and add ``%APPDATA%/Python/Scripts``
  to ``%PATH%``

otherwise ``pip`` won't install due to ``Access denied`` errors.

Compatibility note:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``PyGitUp`` is not compatible with Python 3 because some essential 3rd party
libs don't support it. Sorry.

How to configure it?
--------------------

To configure ``PyGitUp``, you can set options in your git config. Run
``git config [--global] git-up.[name] [value]`` to set one of these
options:

-  ``git-up.bundler.check [true|*false*]``: If set to
   ``true``,\ ``PyGitUp`` will check your app for any new bundled gems
   and suggest a ``bundle install`` if necessary.

-  ``git-up.bundler.autoinstall [true|*false*]``: If set to
   ``true``,\ ``PyGitUp`` will run ``bundle install`` automatically.
   Requires ``git-up.bundler.check`` to be true.

-  ``git-up.bundler.local [true|*false*]``: If you've ``bundle package``-ed
   your  project gems, you can tell ``PyGitUp`` to run ``bundle install
   --local`` for you if it finds missing gems. Much faster than just a plain
   old ``bundle install``. Don't worry if you're missing gems, it will
   backtrack to ``bundle install`` if anything goes wrong. Make sure
   ``git-up.bundler.autoinstall`` is also set to ``true`` or it won't do
   anything.

- ``git-up.bundler.rbenv [true|*false*]``: If you have rbenv installed,
  you can tell ``PyGitUp`` to run ``rbenv rehash`` for you after it installs
  your gems so any binaries will be available right away. Make sure ``git-up
  .bundler.autoinstall`` is also set to ``true`` or it won't do anything.

-  ``git-up.fetch.prune [*true*|false]``: If set to ``true``,
   ``PyGitUp`` will append the ``--prune``\ option to ``git fetch`` and
   thus remove any remote tracking branches which no longer exist on
   the remote (see `git fetch
   --help <http://linux.die.net/man/1/git-fetch>`__).

-  ``git-up.fetch.all [true|*false*]``: If set to ``false``, ``PyGitUp``
   will only fetch remotes for which there is at least one local
   tracking branch. Setting this option will make ``git up`` always fetch
   from all remotes, which is useful if e.g. you use a remote to push to
   your CI system but never check those branches out.

-  ``git-up.rebase.arguments [string]``: If set, ``PyGitUp`` will use
   this string as additional arguments when calling ``git rebase``.
   Example: ``--preserve-merges`` to recreate merge commits in the
   rebased branch.

-  ``git-up.rebase.auto [*true*|false]``: If set to ``false``,
   ``PyGitUp`` won't rebase your branches for you but notify you that
   they diverged. This can be useful if you have a lot of in-progress
   work that you don't want to deal with at once, but still want to
   update other branches.

-  ``git-up.rebase.log-hook [cmd]``: Runs ``cmd`` every time a branch
   is rebased or fast-forwarded, with the old head as ``$1`` and the new
   head as ``$2``. This can be used to view logs or diffs of incoming
   changes. Example:
   '``echo "changes on $1:"; git log --oneline --decorate $1..$2``'

New in v1.0.0:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``git-up.updates.check [*true*|false]``: When running ``git up --version``,
  it shows the version number and checks for updates. If you nevertheless
  feel uncomfortable with it, just set it to ``false`` to turn off the checks.

Changelog
---------

v1.1.3 (*2014-03-23*)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``ahead of upstream`` messages are now cyan (see `aanand/git-up#60 <https://github.com/aanand/git-up/issues/60>`__)
- Fixed problem when using % in the log hook (`#1 <https://github.com/msiemens/PyGitUp/issues/11>`__)

v1.1.2 (*2013-10-08*)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed problems with the dependency declaration.

v1.1.1 (*2013-10-07*)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fix for `#7 <https://github.com/msiemens/PyGitUp/issues/6>`__
  (AttributeError: 'GitUp' object has no attribute 'git') introduced by
  v1.1.0.

v1.1.0 (*2013-10-07*)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Prior to v1.1.0, ``PyGitUp`` tried to guess the upstream branch for a local
  branch by looking for a branch on any remote with the same name. With v1.1.0,
  ``PyGitUp`` stops guessing and uses the upstream branch config instead.

  This by the way fixes issue `#6 <https://github.com/msiemens/PyGitUp/issues/6>`__
  (``git up`` doesn't work with local only branches).

  **Note:**
  This change may break setups, where a local branch accidently has
  the same name as a remote branch without any tracking information set. Prior
  to v1.1.0, ``git up`` would still fetch and rebase from the remote branch.
  If you run into troubles with such a setup, setting tracking information
  using ``git branch -u <remote>/<remote branch> <local branch>`` should help.

- 3rd party dependencies have been updated.

- Allows to run ``git up --version`` from non-git dirs, too.

v1.0.0 (*2013-09-05*)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Finally ``PyGitUp`` reaches 1.0.0. You can consider it stable now :)

- Added a comprehensive test suite, now with a coverage of about 90%.
- Lots of code cleanup.
- Added option ``-h`` to display a help screen (``--help`` **won't** work, because
  ``git`` catchs this option and handles it before ``PyGitUp`` can do).
- Added option ``--version`` to show, what version of ``PyGitUp`` is running.
  Also checks for updates (can be disabled, see configuration).
- Added option ``--quiet`` to be quiet and only display error messages.

v0.2.3 (*2013-06-05*)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed issue `#4 <https://github.com/msiemens/PyGitUp/issues/4>`__ (ugly
  exception if remote branch has been deleted).

v0.2.2 (*2013-05-04*)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed issue `#3 <https://github.com/msiemens/PyGitUp/issues/3>`__ (didn't
  return to previous branch).


v0.2.1 (*2013-03-18*)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed problem: check-bundler.rb has not been installed when installing via
  PyPI (problems with setup.py).

v0.2 (*2013-03-18*)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Incorporated `aanand/git-up#41 <https://github
  .com/aanand/git-up/pull/41>`__: Support for ``bundle install --local`` and
  ``rbenv rehash``.
- Fixed issue `#1 <https://github.com/msiemens/PyGitUp/issues/1>`__ (strange
  output buffering when having multiple remotes to fetch from).
- Some under-the-hood improvements.

v0.1 (*2013-03-14*)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Initial Release
